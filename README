This is a great (I think) improvement of the plugin increment.vim made by William Natter (natter at magma.ca) (vimscript #842). 

I tried to contact William, but his mailbox does not exist... So here it goes.

As William wrote:
"This is a handy plugin that makes easy replacing your favorite pattern ("@" by default) with a sequence of incremented values using the "Inc" command.  "

Besides what the original script can do, it has two new features:
    a) Now you are able to search for a pattern and replace the Nth word from the beginning of the line with the incremental number. 
    b) And also you can get a confirmation message before change.

The help file is also greatly improved.

Here is an example:

       You have: (beginning with spaces only)
           ----- cut -----
                   LMsgInstall6 = 7; // @
                 LMsgInstall7 = 8;   // @
               LMsgInstall8 = 9;     // @

               {STANDALONE}
               LErrConnectionStandAlone1 = 10; //THIS
               LErrConnectionStandAlone3 = 7; //THIS
               LErrConnectionStandAlone5 = 12; //THIS
           {some text}
               LMsgExitConfirm = 30;
           ...
           ----- cut -----

       You do: (with confirmation) 
           :'<,'>Inc p^\ *\\\<\[A-Za-z0-9_]*\\\>\ =\ [0-9]* w3 i25 s100 c
                                   (Note that I had to use tree "\" before the "<" sign. Since Vim 7 the "<" and ">" have to be skiped by a "\")

       You get:
           ----- cut -----
                   LMsgInstall6 = 100; // @
                 LMsgInstall7 = 125;   // @
               LMsgInstall8 = 150;     // @

               {STANDALONE}
               LErrConnectionStandAlone1 = 175; //THIS
               LErrConnectionStandAlone3 = 200; //THIS
               LErrConnectionStandAlone5 = 225; //THIS
           {some text}
               LMsgExitConfirm = 250;
           ...
           ----- cut -----

       Then you do: (without confirmation)
           :'<,'>Inc pTHIS w3 i3 s5

       You get:
           ----- cut -----
                   LMsgInstall6 = 100; // @
                 LMsgInstall7 = 125;   // @
               LMsgInstall8 = 150;     // @

               {STANDALONE}
               LErrConnectionStandAlone1 = 5; //THIS
               LErrConnectionStandAlone3 = 8; //THIS
               LErrConnectionStandAlone5 = 11; //THIS
           {some text}
               LMsgExitConfirm = 250;
           ...
           ----- cut -----

       Then you do: (without confirmation)
           :'<,'>Inc

       You get:
           ----- cut -----
                   LMsgInstall6 = 100; // 0
                 LMsgInstall7 = 125;   // 1
               LMsgInstall8 = 150;     // 2

               {STANDALONE}
               LErrConnectionStandAlone1 = 5; //THIS
               LErrConnectionStandAlone3 = 8; //THIS
               LErrConnectionStandAlone5 = 11; //THIS
           {some text}
               LMsgExitConfirm = 250;
           ...
           ----- cut -----

Hope it helps.
